- [ ] Collect all dirty lines througout the space
- [ ] Unplug appliances before cleaning, for your safety and to protect fixtures.

### Step 2: Clean
Cleaning is removing dust and dirt from surfaces, such as floors and countertops. Make sure you:

- [ ] Spray the toilet bowl with cleaning vinegar in spray bottle to disinfect. Leave it to kill the pathogens claimed on the label. 
- [ ] Inspect the linens if it needs some spot cleaning.
- [ ] Wash white linens at the highest heat setting possible with detergent and booster
- [ ] Wash other linens in normal heat setting (or high heat when possible) and use Bulk or Heavy Mode in the Washing Machine. Remember to wash your hands before you handle any clean linens. 
- [ ] Wash dish towels with bleach and in the highest heat setting possible
- [ ] Wash kitchen towels in the highest heat setting possible
- [ ] Collect dirty dishes, and wash them. Empty the dishwasher if available on-site. 
- [ ] Go through appliances such as the microwave oven, toaster oven, or refrigerator and clean them up.
- [ ] Sweep, vacuum, dust, and/or mop areas before sanitizing. Start from the top down to ensure there are no visible signs of dirt. Sweep all hard surface floors and vacuum carpeting.
- [ ] Wipe down hard surfaces with soap and water.  When mopping, work from the back corner of the room to the front, and dispose of the water in a sink that has not yet been cleaned.
- [ ] Clean soft surfaces based on the manufacturer’s instructions. Soft surfaces include things like carpet, bedding, and upholstery. If soiled, carefully remove any visible dirt or grime, then clean with the appropriate cleaners. If possible, machine-wash items according to the manufacturer’s instructions

### Step 3: Sanitize
Sanitizing is when you use chemicals to reduce bacteria on surfaces such as doorknobs and TV remotes. Be sure to:

- [ ] Once a hard surface is clean, spray high-touch surfaces in each room with an approved disinfectant spray such as the vinegar-water mix.
- [ ] Let the disinfectant stand for the length of time specified on the product label
- [ ] Allow the surface to air-dry.
- [ ] Clean the toilet. Use baking soda as a gentle scrubber when necessary.
- [ ] To put the disinfectant discs in the toilet water tank, first, take off the lid. Then, gently stir the area with an old disinfectant disc using your hand. You'll see this spot mostly in the right side of the overflow tube. While stirring, flush the toilet frequently until you see clearer water in both the tank and the bowl. Replace it with a new disinfectant disc in the same area and put the lid back on.

### Step 4: Check
Once you’re done sanitizing, it’s a good idea to make sure you’ve not missed anything. Be sure to:

- [ ] Refer to the best practices in each room-by-room checklist in your handbook to make sure you haven’t missed a spot, if available.
- [ ] Share these best practices with your hosting team and cleaning professionals

### Step 5: Reset
To help prevent cross-contamination, it's important to finish cleaning and sanitizing a room before replacing items for the next guest:

- [ ] Safely remove any cleaning gear once you are done cleaning
- [ ] Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water before replacing guest supplies, linens, and cleaning kits
- [ ] Refill guest cleaning supply bottles, you'll find these in the bathroom and kitchen cabinets
- [ ] Safely dispose of or wash cleaning supplies and protective gear. Wash your cleaning supplies and tools used. Wash any cleaning cloths at the highest heat setting possible that is appropriate for the material.
- [ ] Don’t re-enter a room once it’s been sanitized
- [ ] Clean your equipment between each turnover
